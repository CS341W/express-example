We are now on Chapter 7 in the book.

For this Tuesday night’s class I want them to use Express Handlebars for an in-class workshop assignment. Nothing fancy, but would like them to take a basic boilerplate site and make it more dynamic through implementation of server side templating with Express-Handlebars.

I will use Git Classroom to create a repo off of our template repo.

The README.md should provide the business requirements, including a description of the kinds of data (e.g., movies, cars) and the elements needed (e.g., make, year, model, cost / title, year, studio, gross).

Nothing too fancy here, but the exercise should require them to make use of flow and conditional patterns, including #each, #if, #else.

Don’t require any form input or routing or GET variables.

It will just be a straightforward output based on the context object we are passing at runtime.

Please let me know if you might have time to put something together by Tuesday.
